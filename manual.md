This is a machine learning based Diebetes Prediction Project.

Goal : "Predict if a  person will develop diabetes"

Solution Statement Goals : 1.Define scope(inclding data sources)
                           2.Define target performance
                           3.Define context for usage
                           4.Define how solution will be created

Solution Statement : "Use the Machine Learning Workflow to process & transform Pima Indian data to create a prediction model.This model must predict which people are likely to develop diabetes with 70% or greater accuracy"
